= Introduction to CF CLI

- Change the working directory to be _devops-workshop/labs/samples_
+
Note the sub-directories present..
+
[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
samples
├── coldfusion-example
├── dotnet-core-sample
├── go-sample
├── nodejs-sample
├── python-sample
---------------------------------------------------------------------
+
-> If you want to be able to deploy these samples you must have _Go_, _Node_, _.Net Core_, and _Python_ installed.

== How to target a foundation and login

. Open a Terminal (e.g., _cmd_ or _bash_ shell)

. Target a foundation and login
+
*PWS*
+
----
$ cf api https://api.run.pivotal.io --skip-ssl-validation
$ cf login
----
+
Enter your account username and password, then select an org and space.

== How to deploy an application

. Let's take a look at the CF CLI options
+
  cf help -a

. Let's see what buildpacks are available to us
+
  cf buildpacks

. Peruse the services you can provision and bind your applications to
+
  cf marketplace
  
. Time to deploy an app. How about Node.js? 
+
  cd nodejs-sample
  cf push -c "node server.js"
+
If you are having trouble resolving artifacts, you are likely running in a https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/node/index.html#yarn_disconnected[disconnected] environment, so follow these steps and try pushing the app again.
+
  yarn config set yarn-offline-mirror ./npm-packages-offline-cache
  cp ~/.yarnrc .
  rm -rf node_modules/ yarn.lock
  yarn install
  
. Next, let's try deploying a Python app.
+
  cd ../python-sample
  cf push my_pyapp
  
. Rinse and repeat for .Net Core and Go apps
+
  cd ../dotnet-core-sample
  cf push
  cd ../go-sample
  cf push awesome-go-app -m 64M --random-route

. And for our final trick, how about deploying a Cold Fusion app?
+
  cd.. coldfusion-example
+
Grab this https://storage.googleapis.com/cphillipson-workshops/devops-workshop/devops-workshop-cfmagic.zip[file], unpack into `src/main/webapp` folder with
+
  unzip -q cfmagic.zip ./src/main/webapp
+
Then execute
+
  gradle war
  cf push
  
. Check what applications have been deployed so far
+
  cf apps
+
-> Take some time to visit each of the applications you've just deployed.

. Let's stop an app, then check that it has indeed been stopped
+
  cf stop cf-nodejs
  cf apps
  
== How to cleanup after yourself

. Finally, let's delete an app
+
  cf delete cf-nodejs
+  
-> Repeat `cf delete` for each app you deployed.
